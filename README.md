# Heros and Heroines

I scraped over a 1000 movie scripts and looked at how male and female roles appear in them.

A [similar project](https://pudding.cool/2017/08/screen-direction/) has been published in 2017 on pudding.

## Data

The data was collected from [imdb](www.imdb.com) and [imsdb](www.imsdb.com), as I matched all the available scripts to imdb searches using the following script.

## Results

A lot of pretty pictures and visualisations here later on
